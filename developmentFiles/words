Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. Going through life with no obstacles would cripple us. We will not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. Just like a butterfly must structure from its cocoon to emerge into its beautiful form. Your pain is leading you to your greatness! Keep your head up high, you are coming out victorious. Keep holding on! A better life awaits you! ~ Icent Francis
